# Data-Manipulation
Quick experiments in data manipulation using Python

# Things I want to be able to do:
## - [ ] Do a data overview of various stats that might be useful, and print to file
- [ ] Data visualisation for different fields
  - [ ] Gender distribution of passengers using bar chart
  - [ ] Histogram of flight status to see distribution of cancelled, delayed, on-time flights
  - [ ] Scatter plot, geographical map to show flight routes based on origin and destination
- [ ] Time-Series analysis on number of flights over days, months and seasons
- [ ] Use longitute, latitude to create a map of airports and where flights travel between
- [ ] Flight status prediction based on airline, origin, dest, and departure time?
- [ ] Compile results in a Jupyter notebook?
- [ ] Possibly create a web visualiser for the data?
- [ ] Documentation throughout
- [ ] GitHub actions to automate creating the notebook?
