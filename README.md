# Data-Manipulation
Quick experiments in data manipulation using Python

# Things I want to be able to do:
- [x] Do a data overview of various stats that might be useful
- [x] Print overview to file
- [ ] Data visualisation for different fields
  - [ ] Gender distribution of passengers using bar chart
  - [ ] Histogram of flight status to see distribution of cancelled, delayed, on-time flights
  - [ ] Scatter plot, geographical map to show flight routes based on origin and destination
- [ ] Time-Series analysis on number of flights over days, months and seasons
- [ ] Use longitute, latitude to create a map of airports and where flights travel between
- [ ] Flight status prediction based on airline, origin, dest, and departure time?
- [ ] Compile results in a Jupyter notebook?
- [ ] Possibly create a web visualiser for the data?
- [ ] Documentation throughout
- [ ] GitHub actions to automate creating the notebook?


## How to use:
1. Fork repo
2. Upload your own .csv with the same fields as in the mock_flight_data.csv
3. Replace filename in insights.py with your CSV's filename.
4. Get insights into the data by running the below in Terminal: 
python3 insights.py
5. Output is printed directly into command line

Or, you know, refer to the insights.ipynb
